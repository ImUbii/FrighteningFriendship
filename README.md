# FrighteningFriendship
a 2D platformer game created from scratch entirely with Java. Significant features include a scrolling level, collision, original music/sound effects, and multiple menus/game states.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Unzip the ZIP file, compile Main.java, and JAR the files. Execute the JAR file to run.

All art and music/sound effects were created by me. The art was made in [Asperite](https://www.aseprite.org/) and the music/sound effects were made in [beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co/).
